### Wings of War: Dawn of War Helper

This ultra-light client-side app is the first of a series of boargame helpers. Boardgames sometimes have a lot of bookkeeping that can drag them down. My goal is to try and cut-down on unnecessary bookkeeping by creating these little helpers.

The only rules I set myself for creating these are:
 * no server-side code
 * no database
 *  try and use css instead of js where possible

Well er on that third point I mostoy failed but I will get better :D

Enjoy, if you're into that sort of things.
